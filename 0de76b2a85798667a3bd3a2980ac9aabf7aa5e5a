      "message": "After some thoughts I went back to my initial idea (no pun intended), which is removing all .iml and .idea.\n\nCouple of reasons behind that:\n\n- We should make ring the more IDE-agnostic possible.\n- We are using gradle to manage this project. It already has all the info needed, and what Android Studio does is simply read the gradle files to map them to an IDEA configuration.\n- Depending on the version of the Intellij IDEA or Android studio IDE a developer is using, even the current .idea config could fail.\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/2s5ipm/keep_iml_files_in_source_control/\n\nhttps://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544839-How-to-manage-projects-under-Version-Control-Systems\n\nIn the comment section:\n\t\n\n\u003e David Perez December 28, 2015 18:39\n\u003e I like this idea.\n\u003e As different people may have different versions of IDEA, and if your project imports cleanly from SBT, Maven or Gradle, another approach is not to have any.idea/ files under version control.\"",
