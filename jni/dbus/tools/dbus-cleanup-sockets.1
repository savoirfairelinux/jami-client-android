.SH NAME
dbus-cleanup-sockets \- clean up leftover sockets in a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fIdbus-cleanup-sockets\fP command cleans up unused D-Bus
connection sockets. See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for
more information about the big picture.

.PP
If given no arguments, \fIdbus-cleanup-sockets\fP cleans up sockets 
in the standard default socket directory for the
per-user-login-session message bus; this is usually /tmp. 
Optionally, you can pass a different directory on the command line.

.PP
On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults
to using "abstract sockets" that exist only in memory and don't have a
corresponding file in /tmp. 

.PP
On most other flavors of UNIX, it's possible for the socket files to
leak when programs using D-Bus exit abnormally or without closing
their D-Bus connections. Thus, it might be interesting to run
dbus-cleanup-sockets in a cron job to mop up any leaked sockets.
Or you can just ignore the leaked sockets, they aren't really hurting
anything, other than cluttering the output of "ls /tmp"
