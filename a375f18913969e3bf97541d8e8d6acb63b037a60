When I turn on the internet connection, Jami gets a token from Firebase and sets it correctly, but this only happens _after_ it\u0027s already connected to the DHT proxy server and done \u0027listen\u0027 operations. (I don\u0027t know if the order of events is deterministic or if there\u0027s a race condition here, but this is what I\u0027ve seen in all my tests so far.)",
