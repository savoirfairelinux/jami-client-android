      "message": "- Well this is related since we are modifying the layout of the EditText. Having a fixed hint size (at least in english/french it is displaying ok) helps to not have a three line tall EditText when opening a conversation.\n\n- This is already in production (Play Store / FDroid) since it comes from the patch about the message engine:\n\nhttps://gerrit-ring.savoirfairelinux.com/#/c/3976/9/ring-android/app/src/main/java/cx/ring/client/ConversationActivity.java\n\nVersion 9 of the patch written by you.\n\nI understand this is not intuitive, and this will change. But at some point we have to move forward.\nUsers have already been seeing only \u0027Write a message\u0027 as a hint for more than a month, we are not modifying the behaviour of the app with this patch.\n\nWe will in a future one.",
