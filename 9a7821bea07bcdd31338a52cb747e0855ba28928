      "message": "I don\u0027t have a concrete answer to this myself.  Anyone know if Android\ncan pick localized strings from a region-specific locale if available\nand otherwise fall back on the \"main\" or the most generic one?  And\nwould such a thing even make sense?\n\nFor example, let\u0027s say there\u0027s a main ar (\"Arabic\") language and then\nregional variations like ar-EG (for Egypt).  If someone uses ar-EG on\ntheir phone, would Android pick any strings that are available in the\nar-EG version and pick the rest from ar?  Or would it only pick from\nar-EG and for the missing ones fall back to English?\n\nIn short, if there are no serious downsides to having region-specific\nvariants then I guess I\u0027d be in favour of keeping them, since at least\nin principle they would enable more users to use Jami in a language\nmost close to theirs.\n\nWhat do you think?
