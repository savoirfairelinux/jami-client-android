Jami [1], a GNU package, is software for universal and distributed peer-to-peer communication that respects the freedom and privacy of its users.

Jami is the simplest and easiest way to connect with people (and devices) with instant messaging, audio and video calls over the Internet and LAN/WAN intranets.

Jami is a free/libre, end-to-end encrypted, and private communication platform.

Jami – which used to be known as Ring – is also an open-source alternative (to Facebook Messenger, Signal, Skype, Teams, Telegram, TikTok, Viber, WhatsApp, Zoom) that prioritizes the privacy of its users.

Jami has a professional-looking design and is available for a wide range of platforms. Unlike the alternatives, calls using Jami are directly between users as it does not use servers to handle calls.

This gives the greatest privacy as the distributed nature of Jami means your calls are only between participants.

One-to-one and group conversations with Jami are enhanced with: instant messaging; audio and video calling; recording and sending audio and video messages; file transfers; screen sharing; and, location sharing.

Jami can also function as a SIP client.

Jami has multiple extensions [2] available: Audio Filter; Auto Answer; Green Screen; Watermark; and, Whisper Transcript.

Jami can be easily deployed in organizations with the “Jami Account Management Server” (JAMS) [3], allowing users to connect with their corporate credentials or create local accounts. JAMS allows you to manage your own Jami community while taking advantage of Jami’s distributed network architecture.

Jami is available for GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Android TV, making Jami an interoperable and cross-platform communication framework.

Manage multiple SIP accounts, Jami accounts and JAMS accounts with the Jami client installed on one or multiple devices.

Jami is free, unlimited, private, advertising free, compatible, fast, autonomous, and anonymous.
