So sorry for the delay for the review.\n\nFrom a first read, I don\u0027t understand why you let the fragment create ContactAction() for color and symbol. I think we don\u0027t need them at all. I would just put the condition `if(conversation.mode.blockingFirst() \u003d\u003d Conversation.Mode.Request)` around all the stuff related to colorAction, symbolAction and lines adding them to the adapter.\n\nHowever I will test this on Monday and I\u0027ll let you know.",
